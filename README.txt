Team 1 group project repo

Welcome to the repo, ladies and gentlemen. This will be the place where the magic happens and will keep the files that all of team members will draw from. That being said, I will have a back up saved on my local machine just in the event of any mishaps that might happen. 

If you feel that the repo is corrupted or would like to see the back-up posted, please message me on slack, email or by phone. I will update my local back-up at the end of the week on Sunday 8pm every week until project completion.

There will be four folders in the repo all relating to either a certain stage of project or materials that can be drawn on for reference.

Please use them for their intended use and ask before creating new folders or repos. If there is any questions on the structure of the repo or any thoughts/concerns, feel free to come to me. Critism and comments are welcomed, my only fear is a job not done. 


Good to be working with you,
Cristo Sparks
