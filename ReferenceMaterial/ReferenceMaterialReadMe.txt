This folder will store all reference materials that can't be place in the other folders. These files may include any mockups, pdfs given by Merit America or any website content not yet placed. If you feel like that it can be better organized by topic, feel free to create a subfolder relating to that subject. You may ask for guidance from me if you uncertain as I periodically organize the folder on a weekly basis.

Contact me by E-mail, Slack or phone if you have any questions
