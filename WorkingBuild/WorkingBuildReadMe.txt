This folder will contain the final product that will be submitted to the Merit America staff for submission at the end of our 4th Project Week. During the weekend of submission, the team will go through this file together to confirm that the site is up to expectations and all irrelvant files are removed.

Let's go for gold, ladies and gentlemen.
